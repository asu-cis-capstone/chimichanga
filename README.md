##IDEA

We want to create a mobile game that is both addicting and rewarding. We will research games that are currently popular as well as reaching out to individual gamers to get the necessary feedback in order to create the perfect game for our target audience.

After initial research, we have decided to go with a Space Pirate themed game, with ASU CIS professors as the main bosses. We believe this will help get the ball rolling with downloads as there will already be an established customer base: CIS students who want to battle their professors! We used Dr. Clark and Dr. Mazzola as the first and second bosses, respectively. The game will be a top-down, asteroids-like ship shooting game, with multiple types of enemies to encounter. 

We have decided to create custom artwork assets to use while developing the game. The pirate ship, ninja stars, and meteors will be hand-drawn, uploaded, and used in the game. We have also decided to code this game using HTML5 and JavaScript, so that it can be played on any modern device on any modern browser. All one needs to do is navigate to the domain, and the game will load and be playable. 

Note: mobile phones may need to "zoom out" their display in order to see all of the game features.

##END RESULTS

After three iterations of game development and user/player feedback, we have seen some very encouraging metric results. Our percentage of players who experience technical difficulties has dropped from an initial 83% down to 20%. Also, players are increasingly spending more time playing the game. This may be attributable to our boss additions and extra level. Also, cleaning up the technical difficulties likely caused players to stay playing for longer. This is an important metric for the business aspect of the game, because potential advertisers may be interested in how long a player might be exposed to an ad in the margins or upon death.

We have also seen an increase in players who claim they would invite their friends. There were only 50% of players who claimed they would invite their friends after playing the first version, and now with version 3, there are 75% of players who say they would invite their friends to play this game. Inviting your friends is as simple as sharing the link, which is better for a viral spread of the game, should it start to gather attention. The number of players who say they would replay the game has stayed relatively flat throughout the version iterations, beginning and ending at about 83%.
