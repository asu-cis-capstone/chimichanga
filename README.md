- PITCH -
We want to create a mobile game that is both addicting and rewarding. We will research games that are currently popular as well as reaching out to individual gamers to get the necessary feedback in order to create the perfect game for our target audience.

- MEASUREMENT PLAN -
-- User Behavior --
% of people who replay the game at least once
% of people who invite their friends

-- User Results --
Total time played / number of times app launched (average session time)
number of times app crashed / number of times app launched (lower is better)
